I worked with Susanna and couldn't run the exact same scripts as she did - for some reasons i got no .tsv file out of the "generate.py" script. In order to continue work i copied the rqeuired .tsv file from Susanna. The matching script worked out fine then, producing the approriate data for Georeferencing. 

In QGIS I added a layer and also connected the frequencies with graduated symbols (the larger dots represent common frequency - I eliminated class 1 and 2)

Here's the link to my screenshot from QGIS [Csv-and-mapping2]
